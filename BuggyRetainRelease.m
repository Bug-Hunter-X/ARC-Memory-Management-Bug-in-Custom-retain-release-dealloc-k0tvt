In Objective-C, a rare but frustrating bug can occur due to the interaction between ARC (Automatic Reference Counting) and custom retain/release methods. If you manually implement -retain, -release, or -dealloc methods without adhering strictly to the rules of memory management, you might unintentionally create memory leaks or crashes, even if the rest of your code uses ARC correctly.  For instance, forgetting to call [super dealloc] in your custom dealloc method can lead to unexpected behavior. Incorrectly managing retain counts in custom retain/release methods can cause objects to be deallocated prematurely or to linger in memory beyond their intended lifespan.
