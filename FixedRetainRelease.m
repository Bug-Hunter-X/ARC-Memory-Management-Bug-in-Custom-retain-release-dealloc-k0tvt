The corrected implementation ensures that the retain count is managed appropriately. It calls `[super retain]`, `[super release]`, and importantly, `[super dealloc]` to ensure that the superclass's memory management is also handled correctly.  This is crucial to prevent memory leaks and crashes. 

```objectivec
@implementation MyCustomObject

- (id)retain {
    [super retain];
    return self;
}

- (oneway void)release {
    [super release];
}

- (void)dealloc {
    // Release any owned objects
    [myObject release]; // Assuming myObject is a property
    [super dealloc];
}

@end
```
